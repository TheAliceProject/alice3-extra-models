There are various forms to suit individual style.

Each model has a sequence of numbered joints for the lanes, A1, A2… and B1, B2…

## Subdirectories

- `SourceModels` The models in importable form - daes and textures.

- `MyGallery` Model folders that are successful imports of the source models. These can be dropped into MyGallery and used the next time Alice is opened.

- `SampleWorlds` Demonstrations of the models in action.

- `Resources` Things used in the building process, such as blender files, alternative representations, or other relevant, but not required files.
